Suppose that we're building an app that recommends movies. We've scraped a large set of reviews off the web, but (for obvious reasons) we would like to recommend only movies with positive reviews. We will use the Naive Bayes algorithm to train a binary sentiment classifier with a dataset of movie reviews. The task is to learn a bag of words (unigram, bigram) model that will classify a review as positive or negative based on the words it contains.

To run the main program, type  ```python3 mp1.py``` in your terminal.

The main program mp1.py accepts values for a number of tunable parameters. To see the details, type ```python3 mp1.py -h``` in your terminal. Note that you can and should change the parameters as necessary to achieve good performance.
